this is a simple Unity project, with simple menu, animation(one person) who is in the labirint, and he has an aim to overcome all obstacles to get a status "winner" or he will never go out from this labirint. There some sounds and very cool effects. The last but not least is a counting points is also with animation staff.
Just Enjoy with it, cause I get a lot of time to do such cool thing!
